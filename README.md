## Use it

You can use this project to generate fresh quotes for your users, to spice up their day or to help them feel AMAZED again by thing's life has to offer. But you can also use it to sort and fetch data from an API, it has different section that each provide a different way of displaying the data variating from very controlled to putting it all in a list. You can use it as a homepage setup for a more detailed project, or just use the daily randomizer as a building block for your application.

## Install it

This application is rendered server-side. Because of the API you will need to have access to it first. In order to do so:
1. You have to create and account on [API-Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/)
2. Then you will need the API link, which is: [this link](https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/quotes?category=amazing)
3. Add your personal API-key to the link, the key can be found on your personal API-Ninjas account.

**to continue:**

1. Clone my github repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EvaZ7/progressivewebapp.git
```

2. Install the npm packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Start the server locally

```sh
npm run start
```

## The external data source

The data source gives you tons and tons of different quotes, the API of API-Ninjas has a built-in randomizer that gives you up till 10 different quotes every time you refresh it. It also gives you an author name and a category within the string. You can change the category of the API very easily by just changing it within the link. There are tons of different categories to choose from!
